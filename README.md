MKS Mainboard model by Pigeon Print [https://grabcad.com/library/mks-robin-nano-v1-2-1](url)

2020 T nut form jimmi.henry [https://grabcad.com/library/t-nut-m5-for-2020-profile-1](url) Modified a little bit it was too tall 

Warning this model is not 100% accurate 
 
The printer has mods on it 


The bottom plate is about as accurate as I can get it

The top does not have a lid and it is skewed by 0.4mm I think
The motor mounts do not have reinforcements on the back
