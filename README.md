Feel free to DM me if you have any questions  ty88#4122

Warning this model is not 100% accurate 
 
The printer has mods on it 


The bottom plate is about as accurate as I can get it

The top does not have a lid and it is skewed by 0.4mm I think
The motor mounts do not have reinforcements on the back
