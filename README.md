# Flsun-Q5-Delta-3D-model-

Warning this model is not 100% accurate 
  
There are two versions one of them has mods and other one is stock

The bottom plate is about as accurate as I can get it

The top does not have a lid and it is skewed by 0.4mm I think
The motor mounts do not have reinforcements on the back
